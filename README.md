# APIs

## Authentication API here

ðŸš«Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## Payment API here

ðŸš«Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## Misc API here

ðŸš«Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.
